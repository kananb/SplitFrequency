## Description
### About
[Split Frequency]() is a web app built in React that allows you to see a visual representation of the different frequencies that make up your voice. Using the [Fast Fourier Transform](), the audio segment is approximated as a sum of sine waves of different frequencies and amplitudes. After these waves are found, you can then play with their frequencies and listen to how the sound of your voice changes!

### Technologies
* Designed in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/proto/QjNYyTCoumIJxHzEdq7qSM/Split-Frequency?node-id=9%3A7&starting-point-node-id=9%3A7)
* Built with [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* Uses the [Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API) for audio capture and processing
